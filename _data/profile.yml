  <p>
    I study auditory perceptual learning, focusing on how people learn to perceive and process sounds under different training conditions. 
    My work centers on speech perception training, such as learning to distinguish non-native speech sounds and better understand unfamiliar foreign accents. 
    Using behavioral methods and EEG, I investigate the time course of learning and aim to identify the conditions that support learning, as well as the constraints that may limit learning. 
    I am also interested in the clinical applications of my work, particularly in the treatment of speech sound disorders.

    I work in the Psychoacoustics Lab, supervised by <a href = "https://communication.northwestern.edu/faculty/beverly-a-wright.html" target = "_blank">Dr. Beverly A. Wright</a>. 
    I am also currently affiliated with the <a href = "https://soundbrainlab.northwestern.edu/" target = "_blank">SoundBrain Lab</a>, where I am working on a rotation project.
